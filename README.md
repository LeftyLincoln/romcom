# RomCom  

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)

Tom and I built the functionality for a webpage to do multiple things. These included generating random covers upon opening or refreshing the website, being able to click the generate random button, the ability to access a hidden form which the user can then fill out and make their own book. We also were able to store any saved covers, and display them all on a new page. This app is solving the problem of connecting the html to javascript so that the website can be dynamic and have various functionalities. It's solving the issue by connecting event listeners and functions that will do what we want when the user clicks on the website. It's making the website interactive instead of simply static.

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)

A user would open the link to this github repository, then would fork said repositiory. Next they would click the green code, which allows them make a copy of the linked ssh key. The user would then open the terminal to the directory they want to install this, and run git clone (ssh key they copied). From there they would cd into the directory, and then rode code . to open vs code and be up and running. 


### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)

The project was assigned Tuesday afternoon/evening and is due Sunday evening. We had time outside of class, homework, mythicals, to meet up and work on the project. The weekened proved to a valuable open time where we could make progress. We are about to start the third week of Mod 1.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)

The learning goals of this project were to write clean, and dry Javascript. We needed to learn how to figure out the connections between Javascript, HTML, and CSS. We needed to work on branches, which was new and using git collaborative workflow in a partner project. Learning how to work with another and write code together in a driver/navigator fashion was a learning process as well. We worked with Javascript, HTML, and CSS while on the DOM.


### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)

Wins: 
 1. Getting intial traction and figuring out the partner Gitflow was a big win
 2. Getting through iteration 0 was a breakthrough for us, and got the ball rolling
 3. Achieving the make your own cover button functionality felt very satisfying

Challenges:
 1. We weren't able to get all of Iteration 4 completed.
 2. Figuring out the flow of the project
 3. Working in a team environment was new and something we had to figure out.
